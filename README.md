# VozniRed
Aplikacija za nazorni prikaz prihoda naslednjega vlaka in busa v Ljubjani.

HOW TO START:
 - install dependencies for python: pygame, feedparser, urllib2, curl(only on windows)
 - run main.py
 - see the magic happen

Default user commands:
 - (r) - refresh
 - (right arrow) - show previous train
 - (left arrow) - show next train
 - (ESC) - exit program


File Changables.py also contains all the variables that can be changed according to user's likings. 


TODO:
 - if it shows zeros, it means that there is a)some error b)no more buses/trains left that day 
 - if you press close windows with mouse, it does not react. You can only exit with ESC
 - only tested on raspberry pi 2
 

Enjoy exploring!
